## 🏭 Contribute

This is one of my side projects which I made to learn the following:

- React (Fundamentals)
- Context API (For state management)
- Tailwind CSS (An utility first CSS Framework)
- Material UI (A set of pre-made react components)
- And many little _reacty_ things...

So, if you're into any of those or want to go into in future, **this project is dedicated to you.** Give this a ⭐ if you liked!
Go ahead and rip this project apart to learn tidbits of each of the things I mentioned above. I'll make sure to comment as much as possible
to make you get started, ASAP. But still, if you have even silliest of questions or suggestions, do create an issue here.

## 🎉 Getting Started

Make sure you fork it, to make your copy of the repo.

`git clone https://github.com/summitsingh63/bitebuddy.git`

Now it's damn easy.

**Install the dependencies (using `npm` or `yarn`)**

- Using `npm`: `npm install`
- Using `yarn`: `yarn`

**Starting project locally**

`npm run start` or `yarn start`

**Extra information**

- You can run `start` command just to run the react project and see how it works.
- You have to run `dev` command if you want to fiddle with the **tailwind classnames** as it needs to be processed (or watched).

## 🌈 Thanks a thousand

And of course, this couldn't have been possible without the great _free to use_ API called, **MealDB**. You can give that a look on [here](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php).
Their service has been amazing throughout and you can use their API to create your own projects too!

## 🔥 Now, go set the world on fire

Now that's for all. I'll be glad to share them with you 💙
